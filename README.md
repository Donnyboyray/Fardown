# Fardown

When the planet's surface becomes completely uninhabitable, humans move underground to try to survive. In the process, they evolve and mutate far past their original ancestors into something entirely different. In this strange and dark world, they've created organizations and infrastructures based on misreadings of the past and a fear of the future.

Reedy is one of these "townsfolk", living her live out in the small hallways of Fardown with her girlfriend, Pepperjack. It's become a struggle for them to survive recently due Pepperjack falling ill. Play as Reedy trying to find a cure for her beloved in a terrifying world with no ability to speak. 

We are a two person team consisting of an artist who is okay at coding and a musician who likes to write.

Demo release goal is set for this summer :-D
